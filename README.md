Gradio Demo: Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

This notebook demonstrates how to build a multilingual sentiment analysis app using Hugging Face’s XLM-RoBERTa model and Gradio. The app takes a tweet as input and returns its predicted sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) along with a confidence score.

It’s designed to work across multiple languages and is great for exploring how transformer models understand tone and emotion in short texts.

You can run the interactive demo directly in Google Colab:
