# 📊 Project Plan: Twitter-XLM-RoBERTa for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
To evaluate the performance of the multilingual sentiment classification model Twitter-XLM-RoBERTa-base using a benchmark dataset with minimal data preprocessing. This project will include an analysis of model architecture, technical innovations, performance evaluation, and potential real-world applications.

## 📝 Final Deliverables (Due May 11)
- ✅ Code for inference, evaluation, and demo
- ✅ Final Report (`project_report.md`) including:
  1. Model Architecture
  2. Technical Innovations
  3. Input-output demo walkthrough
  4. Evaluation results on real dataset
  5. Future applications
- ✅ Final Slide Deck for presentation

## 👥 Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Evaluation Lead: Member 1 (DS)
- Evaluate the model using a provided dataset (~900 tweets)
- Calculate accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix - this needs to be discussed
- Compare results with paper benchmarks
- Create evaluation plots and write evaluation/report sections

### Model & Demo Lead: Member 2
- Set up Hugging Face inference pipeline
- Develop reusable scripts for sentiment analysis
- Create Jupyter demo to walk through input → output flow
- Document demo process and ensure reproducibility

### Documentation & Presentation Lead: Member 3
- Write model architecture and innovations section based on paper
- Compare Twitter-XLM-RoBERTa to models like BERTweet, XLM-T
- Document folder structure and GitHub workflow
- Create final slides and coordinate project presentation

## 📅 Weekly Timeline

### Week 1 (Apr 5–11): Planning & Setup
- Create GitHub repo and folder structure
- Upload model overview and paper summary
- Assign responsibilities and begin individual branches

### Week 2 (Apr 12–18): Dataset Setup
- Add dataset (~900 tweets)
- Verify format (text, label)
- Write script to load and inspect dataset (minimal preprocessing)

### Week 3 (Apr 19–25): Inference & Predictions
- Run inference pipeline on test data
- Save predictions and true labels
- Begin demo notebook with multilingual examples

### Week 4 (Apr 26–May 2): Evaluation & Model Insights
- Compute evaluation metrics (macro-F1, confusion matrix)
- Plot sentiment distribution and confusion matrices
- Write report sections on architecture, innovations, and model comparisons

### Week 5 (May 3–May 8): Applications & Final Report
- Add section on potential future applications
- Apply model to a specific use case (e.g., brand sentiment)
- Finalize all report sections and internal review

### Week 6 (May 9–11): Presentation & Submission
- Finalize slide deck
- Review and clean up GitHub
- Submit report and code
- Prepare for demo/walkthrough session

## 🔄 GitHub Workflow
- One branch per role: `eval/`, `model/`, `docs/`
- Weekly PRs and commits pushed to `main`
- `updates/week_x_summary.md` tracks progress
- GitHub Issues used for tracking deliverables
